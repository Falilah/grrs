In the Whisper of the Trees
In the whisper of the trees at dawn,
Where light and shadow softly yawn,
A melody of life begins to play,
As night surrenders to the day.

The rivers hum a gentle tune,
Beneath the gaze of a pale moon,
Their waters dance in silver streams,
Reflecting all our hopes and dreams.

The flowers wake with colors bright,
Bowing to the morning light,
Each petal sings a silent song,
Of where they bloom, they do belong.

The mountains stand, so tall, so proud,
Their peaks adorned with a misty shroud,
Guardians of the earth below,
In their strength, the winds do blow.

The world, a canvas vast and wide,
With every breath, the colors glide,
A masterpiece in every hue,
Created just for me and you.

So let us dance beneath the sky,
And watch the clouds go drifting by,
For in this world, so pure, so free,
We find our place, our harmony.
